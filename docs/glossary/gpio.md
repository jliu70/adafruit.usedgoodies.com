GPIO - General Purpose Input/Output 

- standard interface used to connect electronic devices
- can be used with sensors, displays, etc

GPIO are usually in the form of "pins", as opposed to other types of [connectors](connectors.md).

Different Raspberry Pi models have either 26 or 40 GPIO pins. 
The newer Rasbperry Pi models have two banks of 20 pins.
