# Introduction

This guide is for people new to Adafruit and to electronics.  The focus is on the Adafruit ecosystem -- to provide a roadmap for people new to the Adafruit ecosystem.  We will review Adafruit lingo and branding.  This website does not cover electronics in general --  Along the way some electronics will be discussed, but this website will not cover topics in depth.  As much as possible, links to additional resources or references will be provided.


Adafruit is an open-source hardware company which designs custom hardware and components.  Located in New York City, Adafruit was founded by Limor Fried (aka "Lady Ada") in 2005.  All designs and guides are openly shared. 

Adafruit also provides [Learn Guides](https://learn.adafruit.com) which uses the hardware to do cool stuff.
Adafruit has almost 2,500 guides, and it can be overwhelming for those just starting out ("newbies"). 

 




!!! Note 
    While there is no "right" or "wrong" approach to learning electronics, on this website I make some opinionated recommendations geared to the absolute "newbie" â€“ people who are new to both electronics and to the Adafruit ecosystem.  
    
    You will see these labeled as:

    *A Beginner's Recommendation*

    Feel free to ignore my recommendations if you are already knowledgable in electronics in general and just wish to get quickly acclimated with the Adafruit lingo.  Often "newbies" want a clearly defined roadmap, so my recommendations are for those who have no idea where to start and just want to get started somewhere.  I will explain why I make the recommendations.   



# The Adafruit website

Let's begin with a general overview of how the [Adafruit website](https://www.adafruit.com) is organized.  
As of 1/2022, the adafruit.com website has a navigation bar on the top left.

# Learn Guides

Adafruit offers thousands of [learn guides](https://learn.adafruit.com) -- Most Learn Guides are walk throughs of specific projects with Adafruit hardware and software.  Some Learn Guides discuss  electronics topics. 


### Guides for Beginners
[https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/04/20/adafruitlearningsystem-weekly-update-beginner/](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/04/20/adafruitlearningsystem-weekly-update-beginner/)

"If you are just getting started with electronics, it can be difficult to know where to begin. With almost 2,500 guides published on the Adafruit Learning System, it might seem hard to figure out which guides are best for a beginner like you. Thankfully, we have each guide tagged with its difficulty level making it easier for beginners to find the right guides.
We even have a curated beginners page that has a breakdown of guides that might interest those who know nothing about electronics, all the way through those who are just getting their feet wet."

# Shows

Aside from articles on the adafruit.com website, Adafruit broadcasts many shows throughout the week covering various topics.  Most of these shows are posted to YouTube if you miss the live stream.

- Webpage with a description of Adafruit shows [https://www.adafruit.com/shows](https://www.adafruit.com/shows)

The shows are great resources and very informative.  For an absolute newbie, some shows may be hard to digest since there is often an assumption that viewers already possess some basic understanding -- although if you attend a live stream, you may ask questions during the show, and Adafruit will likely answer your questions.


# Adabox

!!! note
    Before we dive into the Adafruit ecosystem, a *Beginner's Recommendation*.

    **Adabox**


[Adabox](https://www.adafruit.com/adabox) is a discovery subscription service with curated Adafruit products.  The target audience is geared towards beginners and hobbyists.

I'm skeptical of many subscription services, but in the case of Adabox, I whole-heartedly recommend that beginners (and non-beginners) give it a try.

Adabox is released on a Quarterly cadence (as much as possible).  
You have the option either to subscribe, or you can gift one or multiple Adabox to yourself (or others).

Each Adabox is standalone and shipped with all the components and parts needed to construct projects.

In my opinion, Adabox is for kids ages 12 and up.  Younger kids may need adults to help them.  
The construction of the hardware is usually not that difficult -- it's more on the software/programming side where younger kids may need adult assistance.


I've been an Adabox subscriber since [Adabox015](https://www.adafruit.com/adabox015/), and I've back purchased [Adabox007](https://www.adafruit.com/adabox007/) and [Adabox014](https://www.adafruit.com/adabox014/), as well as bought the equivalent kits for [Adabox008](https://www.adafruit.com/adabox008/), [Adabox010](https://www.adafruit.com/adabox010/), [Adabox011](https://www.adafruit.com/adabox011/), [Adabox012](https://www.adafruit.com/adabox012/), and [Adabox013](https://www.adafruit.com/adabox013/).  


**PROs**

- Value of all the equipment and shipping often exceeds the amount you pay for the subscription, and Adabox includes custom extras which are not available in their regular online store.  
- Cool unboxing live stream (recorded and available afterwards on YouTube) 
    - Entertaining and goes through the contents of the Adabox
    - Demo of one or two projects is shown.  
    - If you attend the live stream, you may ask questions. 
- Adabox is often accompanied with a long list of Learn Guides (projects).  
    - The Learn Guides are accessible to newbies
- Ask questions or request support via Adafruit's support forums.

**CONs**

- Delivery of the Adabox can be delayed.  The global chip shortage and supply chain delays have made it difficult for Adafruit.  I received the most recent two adaboxes weeks after the official unboxing video (whereas in the past the unboxing videos were timed to coincide with the majority of customers to have already received their Adabox.)
- Occassionally there may be some things mentioned which could be hard for newbies to follow.    (Hence, why I wrote this guide.)
