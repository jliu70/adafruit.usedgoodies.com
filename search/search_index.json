As much as possible, links to additional resources or references will be provided. Adafruit is an open-source hardware company which designs custom hardware and components. Located in New York City, Adafruit was founded by Limor Fried (aka \"Lady Ada\") in 2005. All designs and guides are openly shared. Adafruit also provides Learn Guides which uses the hardware to do cool stuff. Adafruit has almost 2,500 guides, and it can be overwhelming for those just starting out (\"newbies\"). Note While there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" approach to learning electronics, on this website I make some opinionated recommendations geared to the absolute \"newbie\" \u2013 people who are new to both electronics and to the Adafruit ecosystem. You will see these labeled as: A Beginner's Recommendation . Feel free to ignore my recommendations if you are already knowledgable in electronics in general and just wish to get quickly acclimated with the Adafruit lingo. Often \"newbies\" just want a clearly defined roadmap, so my recommendations are for those who have no idea where to start and just want to get started somewhere. I will explain why I make the particular recommendations. The Adafruit website Let's begin with a general overview of how the Adafruit website is organized. As of 1/2022, the adafruit.com website has a navigation bar on the top left. \"Shop\" - the online store where you can peruse product pages, and place online orders. Specific product pages will often include links to related Learn Guides. \"Learn\" - where documenation and Learn Guides are located. More details below. \"Blog\" - Adafruit's blog which is updated daily. \"Forums\" - Adafruit's support forums where you can seek help from customer support or the community. \"LIVE!\" - where you can find Adafruit's currently live streaming show, or if there isn't currently a live stream their main YouTube Channel. More details below. \"AdaBox\" - a link to their order page for Adabox. More on Adabox below. \"IO\" - a link to Adafruit's online service. Learn Guides Adafruit offers thousands of learn guides -- Most Learn Guides are walk throughs of specific projects with Adafruit hardware and software. Some Learn Guides discuss electronics topics. Guides for Beginners https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/04/20/adafruitlearningsystem-weekly-update-beginner/ \"If you are just getting started with electronics, it can be difficult to know where to begin. With almost 2,500 guides published on the Adafruit Learning System, it might seem hard to figure out which guides are best for a beginner like you. Thankfully, we have each guide tagged with its difficulty level making it easier for beginners to find the right guides. We even have a curated beginners page that has a breakdown of guides that might interest those who know nothing about electronics, all the way through those who are just getting their feet wet.\" Adafruit Learn Guides tagged \"beginner\": https://learn.adafruit.com/guides/beginner Adafruit Weekly Trending Learn Guides: https://learn.adafruit.com/guides/trending Git repo for Adafruit Learning Guides (kinda large at 1.1GB): https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides Shows Aside from articles on the adafruit.com website, Adafruit broadcasts many shows throughout the week covering various topics. Most of these shows are posted to YouTube if you miss the live stream. Webpage with a description of Adafruit shows https://www.adafruit.com/shows The shows are great resources and very informative. For an absolute newbie, some shows may be hard to digest since there is often an assumption that viewers already possess some basic understanding -- although if you attend a live stream, you may ask questions during the show, and Adafruit will likely answer your questions. Adabox Note Before we dive into the Adafruit ecosystem, a Beginner's Recommendation . Adabox Adabox is a discovery subscription service with curated Adafruit products. The target audience is geared towards beginners and hobbyists. I'm skeptical of many subscription services, but in the case of Adabox, I whole-heartedly recommend that beginners (and non-beginners) give it a try. Adabox is released on a Quarterly cadence (as much as possible). You have the option either to subscribe, or you can gift one or multiple Adabox to yourself (or others). Each Adabox is standalone and shipped with all the components and parts needed to construct projects. In my opinion, Adabox is for kids ages 12 and up. Younger kids may need adults to help them. The construction of the hardware is usually not that difficult -- it's more on the software/programming side where younger kids may need adult assistance. I've been an Adabox subscriber since Adabox015 , and I've back purchased Adabox007 and Adabox014 , as well as bought the equivalent kits for Adabox008 , Adabox010 , Adabox011 , Adabox012 , and Adabox013 . PROs Value of all the equipment and shipping often exceeds the amount you pay for the subscription, and Adabox includes custom extras which are not available in their regular online store. Cool unboxing live stream (recorded and available afterwards on YouTube) Entertaining and goes through the contents of the Adabox Demo of one or two projects is shown. If you attend the live stream, you may ask questions. Adabox is often accompanied with a long list of Learn Guides (projects). The Learn Guides are accessible to newbies Ask questions or request support via Adafruit's support forums. CONs Delivery of the Adabox can be delayed. The global chip shortage and supply chain delays have made it difficult for Adafruit. I received the most recent two adaboxes weeks after the official unboxing video (whereas in the past the unboxing videos were timed to coincide with the majority of customers to have already received their Adabox.) Occassionally there may be some things mentioned which could be hard for newbies to follow. (Hence, why I wrote this guide.)

The chips that they use are SAMD21 ESP32-S2 ESP32-S3 NRF52840 RP2040 https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/06/qt-py-bluefruit-routin-party/ Now we\u2019ve got the QT Py SAMD21, RP2040 and ESP32-S2 designed and fabricated, we\u2019re going to follow up with an NRF52840 version! We\u2019ve been using the Nordict nRF series for a loooooong time (anyone else remember the nRF8001? it was like the AT90S2313 of bluetooth le for us). nRF52840 is the first one with native USB \u2013 and its plenty fast as a Cortex M4 at 64MHz and 256K of RAM. we already did a module-less route of this chip on the Circuit Playground Bluefruit so we know the schem capture is right. QT Py ESP32-S3 is also next https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/07/qt-py-with-esp32-s3/ this is a swap-out of the ESP32-S2 QT Py for the new ESP32-S3 chip. The S3 is really a nice piece of kit \u2013 dual core is back and it also re-adds BLE. It\u2019s basically an ESP32 with native USB, we\u2019re looking forward to it! note that the S3 chip looks a lot like the S2 but the chip pinout is NOT the same, the reset, and some power pins have moved. and some gpio shifted down one. also, looks like the dual DAC was removed. anyways, just watch out don\u2019t think you can use the exact same layout. we had to shift a few parts but it all still looks like it fits! top part is identical to the S2 QT Py, and the bottom only shifted a few passives around. we\u2019ll get some 4 layer prototypes on order. Desk of Lady Ada https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC7oodxTWgE 1/9/2022 This weekend we cranked through 3.5 QT Py designs (we didnt finish routing one, its a toughie!) - we already make SAMD21, RP2040 and ESP32-S2 and we wanted to add some more chips to the mix: ESP32-S3 (dual core version of the S2), ESP32 Pico (OG ESP with built in flash/psram), ESP32-C3 (Risc-V wifi!) and nRF52840 (BLE wonder-chip from Nordic). the last one is what we didn't get to finish routing because its a particularly tough one. The other 3 worked out fine with a 4 layer PCB. We also designed a few 'BFF' boards - that fit onto a QT Py like a shield. https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/15/feather-huzzah-esp32-v2/ The Feather ESP32 is a classic Adafruit board, used in thousands and thousands of projects. And we love it so\u2026but with the CP2104 going EOL and requiring us to do a light re-spin for the CP2102N revision, we thought maybe we\u2019d do a gut renovation. With the new ESP32 PICO module, we save a ton of space AND have 8 MB Flash / 2MB PSRAM instead of the WROOM\u2019s 4 MB Flash & no PSRAM. the PICO is also much smaller, so we have room to upgrade the USB micro B to Type C, add a NeoPixel, STEMMA QT with separate LDO, and even a user button on the very last unused input pin. However, we did have to shuffle a few pins around. the named pins got some changes, so for example, RX and TX used to be 16 and 17 respectively \u2013 but those pins are used internally on the PICO module so they\u2019re no longer available. on the V2 feather they\u2019re now 8 and 9. all of the analog pins and the numbered pins are the same, just SPI/I2C/UART named pins are different. that should make code be \u2018drop in replacement\u2019 as long as the named pins/ports are used instead of the underlying io pad names. since code needs to be recompiled for the variant, this would be a fully new product ID. however, i think for the bump in capabilities and capacity it is worth an upgrade!

We like the JST PH 2.0mm pitch cables because they are cross-compatible with Grove/Gravity. But they're a bit large for smaller breakout boards and wearables. So, for smaller I2C devices, we'll use the JST SH that SparkFun Qwiic uses, so that Qwiic & STEMMA QT sensors are cross-compatible! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GXRRuFuFy0 https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Qwiic-Hub-p-4531.html Different from our Grove system, Qwiic is an I2C interface system initiated by Sparkfun around 2017, using a 4pin JST SH 1.0mm connector. STEMMA QT initiated by Adafruit is cross-compatible with Qwiic, as they use the same connector/cable. To better support different types of interface systems, we provide Grove - Qwiic Hub, which enables you easily connect the I2C devices with Grove/Qwiic/STEMMA QT interface, get the best use of your devices/controller of different interfaces.

When JST was established in 1957, we were Japan's first manufacturer and distributor of Solderless Terminals. The Great Search: JST Connectors SH and PH https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5XYd0Z0HFw 1/5/2021 1:14 JST PH great for power - Sparkfun originally started LiPo Battery connectors and it became a Maker standard. 2:25 Stemma QT - JST SH - Sparkfun also originated Qwiic for breakout boards Also a brief intro to i2c (i2c has become the standard for sensors - rarely see SPI over sensors anymore) https://youtu.be/s5XYd0Z0HFw?t=169 Grove 10th Anniversary Documentary 12/31/2020 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-W0XYhVdTk NOTE: so STEMMA QT is different to STEMMA (see CircuitPython School video) - STEMMA QT is equivalent to Sparkfun Qwiic.

In addition - on the comparison page it states that Grove is a proprietary 4 pin 2.0mm pitch connector. STEMMA attempts to be as cross-compatible as possible with both Grove and Gravity (compatible connectors & 3-5V power/logic). STEMMA QT is cross-compatible with Qwiic - STEMMA QT connector/cable is same as Qwiic. You can use STEMMA QT devices with Qwiic devices/controllers.

We like the JST PH 2.0mm pitch cables because they are cross-compatible with Grove/Gravity. But they're a bit large for smaller breakout boards and wearables. So, for smaller I2C devices, we'll use the JST SH that SparkFun Qwiic uses, so that Qwiic & STEMMA QT sensors are cross-compatible! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GXRRuFuFy0 https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Qwiic-Hub-p-4531.html Different from our Grove system, Qwiic is an I2C interface system initiated by Sparkfun around 2017, using a 4pin JST SH 1.0mm connector. STEMMA QT initiated by Adafruit is cross-compatible with Qwiic, as they use the same connector/cable. To better support different types of interface systems, we provide Grove - Qwiic Hub, which enables you easily connect the I2C devices with Grove/Qwiic/STEMMA QT interface, get the best use of your devices/controller of different interfaces.","title":"STEMMA and STEMMA QT"},{"location":"hardware/connectors/#jst","text":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JST_connector JST Series \"SH\" 1.00 mm pin-to-pin pitch \"PH\" 2.00mm pin-to-pin pitch https://www.linkedin.com/company/jst-sales-america-inc J.S.T. = Japanese Solderless Terminals As our company name implies, Solderless Terminal, has real significance.

In addition - on the comparison page it states that Grove is a proprietary 4 pin 2.0mm pitch connector.
