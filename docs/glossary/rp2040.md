RP2040

Raspberry Pi Foundation's first microcontroller  `Raspberry Pi Pico` and the chipset `RP2040`.

Adafruit has a great walkthrough on how to [get started with CircuitPython with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython/micropython-or-circuitpython)


The `RP2040` chipset is used by other manufacturers to produce a whole range of new microcontrollers:

The Raspberry Pi Foundation is looking to get kids coding and learning electronics with Raspberry Pi Pico 
https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/pico-intro
Now, thanks to our brand-new and free Introduction to Raspberry Pi Pico learning path, young coders can easily join in and make their own cool Pico projects! This free learning path has six guided projects to help kids to independently develop their coding skills, and their skills in physical computing and electronics.
