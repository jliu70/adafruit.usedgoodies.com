The [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com) is a SBC (Single Board Computer) produced by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://raspberrypi.org).


The Raspberry Pi is a General Purpose Computer which is different from a [microcontroller](microcontroller.md) which is a single purpose computer.  A chart comparing the Raspberry Pi to an Arduino is on the [microcontroller](microcontroller.md) glossary page.



The Raspberry Pi's schematics are released, but the board itself is not open hardware. The Raspberry Pi Foundation relies on income from the sale of Raspberry Pis to do its charitable work.
