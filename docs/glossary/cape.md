Capes
Example: 4.3" LCD Capacitive Touchscreen Display Cape for BeagleBone  https://www.adafruit.com/product/3396

Most of the BeagleBone boards from [BeagleBoard.org](https://beagleboard.org) share the same form factor, have the same headers and therefore can accept the same extension boards, also known as capes in the BeagleBoard world.
