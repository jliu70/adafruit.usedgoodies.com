Copy verification steps
Before we can verify usedgoodies.com, you'll need to complete these steps:

Create a TXT record in your DNS configuration for the following hostname:
	
_github-pages-challenge-jliu70.usedgoodies.com


3c9b0e7c1e6c3486af8fbfe4069988


## Add a DNS CNAME record
adafruit.usedgoodies.com CNAME to jliu70.github.io



# Create the Project Repo
https://github.com/jliu70/adafruit.usedgoodies.com



# Deploy the site via mkdocs
https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/
mkdocs gh-deploy



Project Repo settings > pages > 
choose the branch "gh-pages" and leave default of "/(root)"



Site is now enabled:  http://adafruit.usedgoodies.com

Later on, created a new test github project.  Then just need to create a CNAME record for new sub-domain to same jliu70.github.io. 
Then project settings > pages and that seems to work.
