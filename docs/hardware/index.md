# Hardware

The Adafruit lingo for their hardware is quite extensive and can be confusing to someone new to the Adafruit ecosystem.  One of the primary goals of this website is to help newcomers sort through this cornicopia of terminology.


## Microcontrollers

Adafruit designs and sells their own custom microcontrollers. 

Microcontrollers are single purpose computers 

- small embedded development boards
- limited storage and memory
- limited processing power


Microcontrollers vs General Purpose Computer

- Use of Microcontrollers is fine for many cases
- When you need more computational power, you may want to use a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com)
    - For example, if you wish to have a web dashboard to interface with, then you will need to use a Raspberry Pi


For more info, see the **Glossary** page for [Microcontroller](../glossary/microcontroller.md)


## Recommended: First Adafruit Hardware for Beginners

!!! note
    *A Beginner's Recommendation*.

    **[Circuit Playground Bluefruit](../glossary/circuit_playground#circuit-playground-bluefruit)**

Among the many Adafruit devices, the [Circuit Playground Bluefruit](../glossary/circuit_playground#circuit-playground-bluefruit) is more accesible to beginners.  It is a great piece of hardware to start with.

For more info, see the **Glossary** page for [Circuit Playground Bluefruit](../glossary/circuit_playground#circuit-playground-bluefruit)



## Comprehensive list of hardware supported by CircuitPython
List of all the hardware currently supported by CircuitPython (Adafruit and other manufacturers) is available at the [CircuitPython Downloads Page](https://circuitpython.org/downloads).

As of Feb 2022 

- There are over 270 boards supported by CircuitPython and that list grows everyday.
- The list is sorted by number of downloads.  
    - The most popular board -- the Raspberry Pi Pico -- is not manufactured by Adafruit.

## Adafruit Hardware

Adafruit offers over 60 different microcontrollers.

Within the Adafruit ecosystem, there are a few general categories:

- [Adafruit Feather](../glossary/feather.md) (Regular)
    - Supported by an extensive array of expansion options called [FeatherWings](../glossary/feather.md#featherwing)
- [ItsyBitsy](../glossary/itsy_bitsy.md) (Small)
- [QT Py](../glossary/qt_py.md) (Tiny)
- [Metro](../glossary/metro.md) (Arduino form factor)
- Trinkey (USB dongles)

There are also custom form factors such as 

- [Circuit Playground](../../glossary/circuit_playground)
- [CLUE](../glossary/clue.md)
- Gemma M0
- FunHouse
- PyBadge/EdgeBadge
- Trinket M0
- [Teensy](../glossary/teensy.md)


## Chipsets

Most Adafruit devices use one of the following chipsets: 

- SAMD21
- SAMD51
- ESP32-S2
- ESP32-S3
- NRF52840
- RP2040


You will often see multiple versions of a particular Adafruit form factor based upon different chipsets.

For example:

[Circuit Playground Versions](../glossary/circuit_playground/#circuit-playground)

[QT Py Versions](../glossary/qt_py/#qt-py)
