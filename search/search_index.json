Note A Beginner's Recommendation . CircuitPython What is CircuitPython? This website focuses on CircuitPython which is a version of python for microcontrollers. Adafruit is the principle backer for CircuitPython . I recommend CircuitPython over Arduino for beginners because: Python is a more accesible programming language than C++ (which is what Arduino uses). Python syntax is more similar to plain language Python gives beginners an easier and quicker feedback loop Python code does not need to be compiled in the way that C++ (Arduino) code requirees. With CircuitPython, the code is stored and run directly on the microcontroller, aka \"click save and your code starts running\" Arduino code requires the traditional method of: Compiling code on an external device (e.g., your laptop) Downloading the compiled binary to the microcontroller through the Arduino IDE Debugging the code Watching the output Because of these and other reasons, Python continues to be increasingly used for microcontroller projects. MakeCode Note Great for younger students, MakeCode is a blocked-based programming language which is similar to Scratch . Block-based programming, such as MakeCode or Scratch , is great for younger beginners. Using drag-and-drop blocks avoids common syntax errors like typos or formatting issues, which can be source of frustration for new programmers. However, the power and flexiblity of block-based programs is limited. Hence for older students, or those students already experienced with Scratch or MakeCode , I recommend jumping straight into python. For those looking to ease the transition from block-based programming to python, EduBlocks is an interesting hybrid which offers python in a block-based format. What about Micropython? MicroPython is an open source Python programming language interpretor that runs on small embedded development boards, aka microcontrollers . Lean and efficient implementation of Python 3 Includes a small subset of Python standard library Optimized to run on microcontrollers CircuitPython is a fork of Micropython. While CircuitPython looks somewhat like MicroPython there are some differences . While I\u2019d generally point folks towards MicroPython if they need advanced features like interrupts and threading \u2014 or complete access to the RP2040\u2019s Programmable I/O (PIO) in Python \u2014 for library support for sensors and other breakouts I would point you to CircuitPython.

The focus is on the Adafruit ecosystem Roadmap for people new to the Adafruit ecosystem. Review Adafruit lingo and branding. This website does not cover electronics in general -- Along the way some electronics is discussed, but this website does not cover topics in depth. As much as possible, links to additional resources or references will be provided. Adafruit is an open-source hardware company which designs custom hardware and components. Located in New York City, Adafruit was founded by Limor Fried (aka \"Lady Ada\") in 2005. All designs and guides are openly shared. Adafruit also provides Learn Guides which uses the hardware to do cool stuff. Adafruit has almost 2,500 guides, and it can be overwhelming for those just starting out (\"newbies\"). Note While there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" approach to learning electronics, on this website I make some opinionated recommendations geared to the absolute \"newbie\" \u2013 people who are new to both electronics and to the Adafruit ecosystem. You will see these labeled as: A Beginner's Recommendation Feel free to ignore my recommendations if you are already knowledgable in electronics in general and just wish to get quickly acclimated with the Adafruit lingo. Often \"newbies\" want a clearly defined roadmap, so my recommendations are for those who have no idea where to start and just want to get started somewhere. I will explain why I make the recommendations. The Adafruit website Let's begin with a general overview of how the Adafruit website is organized. As of 1/2022, the adafruit.com website has a navigation bar on the top left. \"Shop\" - the online store where you can peruse product pages, and place online orders. Specific product pages will often include links to related Learn Guides. \"Learn\" - where documenation and Learn Guides are located. More details below. \"Blog\" - Adafruit's blog which is updated daily. \"Forums\" - Adafruit's support forums where you can seek help from customer support or the community. \"LIVE!\" - where you can find Adafruit's currently live streaming show, or if there isn't currently a live stream their main YouTube Channel. More details below. \"AdaBox\" - a link to their order page for Adabox. More on Adabox below. \"IO\" - a link to Adafruit's online service. Learn Guides Adafruit offers thousands of learn guides -- Most Learn Guides are walk throughs of specific projects with Adafruit hardware and software. Some Learn Guides discuss electronics topics. Guides for Beginners https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/04/20/adafruitlearningsystem-weekly-update-beginner/ \"If you are just getting started with electronics, it can be difficult to know where to begin. With almost 2,500 guides published on the Adafruit Learning System, it might seem hard to figure out which guides are best for a beginner like you. Thankfully, we have each guide tagged with its difficulty level making it easier for beginners to find the right guides. We even have a curated beginners page that has a breakdown of guides that might interest those who know nothing about electronics, all the way through those who are just getting their feet wet.\" Adafruit Learn Guides tagged \"beginner\": https://learn.adafruit.com/guides/beginner Adafruit Weekly Trending Learn Guides: https://learn.adafruit.com/guides/trending Git repo for Adafruit Learning Guides (kinda large at 1.1GB): https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides Shows Aside from articles on the adafruit.com website, Adafruit broadcasts many shows throughout the week covering various topics. Most of these shows are posted to YouTube if you miss the live stream. Webpage with a description of Adafruit shows https://www.adafruit.com/shows The shows are great resources and very informative. For an absolute newbie, some shows may be hard to digest since there is often an assumption that viewers already possess some basic understanding -- although if you attend a live stream, you may ask questions during the show, and Adafruit will likely answer your questions. Adabox Note Before we dive into the Adafruit ecosystem, a Beginner's Recommendation . Adabox Adabox is a discovery subscription service with curated Adafruit products. The target audience is geared towards beginners and hobbyists. I'm skeptical of many subscription services, but in the case of Adabox, I whole-heartedly recommend that beginners (and non-beginners) give it a try. Adabox is released on a Quarterly cadence (as much as possible). You have the option either to subscribe, or you can gift one or multiple Adabox to yourself (or others). Each Adabox is standalone and shipped with all the components and parts needed to construct projects. In my opinion, Adabox is for kids ages 12 and up. Younger kids may need adults to help them. The construction of the hardware is usually not that difficult -- it's more on the software/programming side where younger kids may need adult assistance. I've been an Adabox subscriber since Adabox015 , and I've back purchased Adabox007 and Adabox014 , as well as bought the equivalent kits for Adabox008 , Adabox010 , Adabox011 , Adabox012 , and Adabox013 . PROs Value of all the equipment and shipping often exceeds the amount you pay for the subscription, and Adabox includes custom extras which are not available in their regular online store. Cool unboxing live stream (recorded and available afterwards on YouTube) Entertaining and goes through the contents of the Adabox Demo of one or two projects is shown. If you attend the live stream, you may ask questions. Adabox is often accompanied with a long list of Learn Guides (projects). The Learn Guides are accessible to newbies Ask questions or request support via Adafruit's support forums. CONs Delivery of the Adabox can be delayed. The global chip shortage and supply chain delays have made it difficult for Adafruit. I received the most recent two adaboxes weeks after the official unboxing video (whereas in the past the unboxing videos were timed to coincide with the majority of customers to have already received their Adabox.) Occassionally there may be some things mentioned which could be hard for newbies to follow. (Hence, why I wrote this guide.)

What is the difference between STEMMA and STEMMA QT STEMMA, QWIIC and Grove Connectors: Which is Right for You? https://www.tomshardware.com/features/stemma-vs-qwiic-vs-grove-connectors 4/24/2021 What are STEMMA and STEMMA QT? Adafruit\u2019s STEMMA connector arrived in 2018 and essentially it is three or four pin JST PH with 2.00 mm pitch, a connector which is keyed so that it cannot be inserted incorrectly. STEMMA is seen on larger boards such as PyPortal which has plenty of space for multiple three and four pin connectors. There are two forms of STEMMA connectors, a three or four pin connector. The three pin connector is used for Pulse Width Modulation, Analog and Digital IO. Using this connector we can control Neopixels, read analog sensors and use digital IO devices such as LEDs and buttons. The four-pin connector is for I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) components, enabling the use of multiple sensors / devices on a single bus thanks to devices having an address which can be read from / written to. STEMMA is a great connector, but for smaller boards, such as Adafruit\u2019s QT Py RP2040 we need something smaller and that is where STEMMA QT (\u2018cutie\u2019) comes in. STEMMA QT is a smaller version of the four pin STEMMA format, roughly half the size of STEMMA, with a 1.0 mm pitch. STEMMA QT is only for use with I2C components. Analog, PWM and digital IO connections are made via the traditional GPIO. The pin order for QT is designed to match the pin order for SparkFun\u2019s QWIIC enabling the use of QWIIC add-ons with STEMMA QT boards and for the reverse to also be true. Examples of STEMMA QT boards are Adafruit\u2019s MPR121 capacitive touch sensor, SGP40 air quality sensor, aBME680 temperature / humidity / pressure sensor and AMG8833 IR thermal camera. What is QWIIC? SparkFun\u2019s QWIIC Connect System was released in 2017 and is for use with I2C components. It is compatible with Adafruit\u2019s STEMMA and STEMMA QT as QWIIC uses the same pin ordering. Qwicc, like STEMMA, uses the I2C protocol and enables components to be daisy chained together. QWIIC connectors can be found on many of SparkFun\u2019s boards such as the MicroMod ATP carrier board which uses an M.2 slot, the MicroMod standard, for interchangeable processor boards such as the ESP32, Artemis and the new RP2040. There are also adapters for using QWIIC components on the Raspberry Pi via a HAT and pHAT and for the Arduino range of boards. With SparkFun\u2019s QWIIC connector we can easily connect sensors such as the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, soil moisture sensor and even a NEO-M9N GPS breakout. What is Seeed Studio\u2019s Grove Connector? Seeed Studio\u2019s Grove connector is a proprietary connector for its range of boards and boards made in partnership with Arduino. The Grove connector is a 4-pin cable which can be used with analog, PWM, digital IO and I2C. Grove is compatible with STEMMA components, but only for I2C devices as analog, PWM and digital IO are not compatible. If you are unsure, just take a look at the component. If it has SDA / SCL pins, then it is an I2C device. If you have never used Grove connections before, then the Grove Beginner Kit is worth your investment. In the kit we get an OLED screen, DHT11 temperature sensor, microphone, light sensor and a bonus Arduino compatible board.

The answer is based on what boards you already have and what you want to achieve. If you have Adafruit\u2019s boards, then you will most likely have some form of STEMMA / STEMMA QT connector and so the entire range of add-ons is available to you. You will also have access to SparkFun\u2019s QWIIC range of add ons which opens up a plethora of options for your projects. This is also true if you have any of SparkFun\u2019s boards with QWIIC connectors. Seeed\u2019s Grove connectors work with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and now the Raspberry Pi Pico. So buying one set of Grove components is good value for those that wish to use them across multiple platforms. Ultimately the choice is yours. What projects you wish to build will dictate the choices that you make. But no matter what choice you make, all of these connectors make electronics a breeze and give you the confidence to learn new skills without worrying about your wiring.","title":"Connectors"},{"location":"glossary/connectors/#connectors","text":"","title":"Connectors"},{"location":"glossary/connectors/#back-to-index","text":"Related I2C , SPI , GPIO It used to be that in order to connect sensors or components you had to use a breadboard or do soldering.

Adafruit\u2019s STEMMA connector arrived in 2018 and essentially it is three or four pin JST PH with 2.00 mm pitch, a connector which is keyed so that it cannot be inserted incorrectly. STEMMA is seen on larger boards such as PyPortal which has plenty of space for multiple three and four pin connectors. There are two forms of STEMMA connectors, a three or four pin connector. The three pin connector is used for Pulse Width Modulation, Analog and Digital IO. Using this connector we can control Neopixels, read analog sensors and use digital IO devices such as LEDs and buttons. The four-pin connector is for I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) components, enabling the use of multiple sensors / devices on a single bus thanks to devices having an address which can be read from / written to. STEMMA is a great connector, but for smaller boards, such as Adafruit\u2019s QT Py RP2040 we need something smaller and that is where STEMMA QT (\u2018cutie\u2019) comes in. STEMMA QT is a smaller version of the four pin STEMMA format, roughly half the size of STEMMA, with a 1.0 mm pitch. STEMMA QT is only for use with I2C components. Analog, PWM and digital IO connections are made via the traditional GPIO. The pin order for QT is designed to match the pin order for SparkFun\u2019s QWIIC enabling the use of QWIIC add-ons with STEMMA QT boards and for the reverse to also be true. Examples of STEMMA QT boards are Adafruit\u2019s MPR121 capacitive touch sensor, SGP40 air quality sensor, aBME680 temperature / humidity / pressure sensor and AMG8833 IR thermal camera. What is QWIIC? SparkFun\u2019s QWIIC Connect System was released in 2017 and is for use with I2C components. It is compatible with Adafruit\u2019s STEMMA and STEMMA QT as QWIIC uses the same pin ordering. Qwicc, like STEMMA, uses the I2C protocol and enables components to be daisy chained together. QWIIC connectors can be found on many of SparkFun\u2019s boards such as the MicroMod ATP carrier board which uses an M.2 slot, the MicroMod standard, for interchangeable processor boards such as the ESP32, Artemis and the new RP2040. There are also adapters for using QWIIC components on the Raspberry Pi via a HAT and pHAT and for the Arduino range of boards. With SparkFun\u2019s QWIIC connector we can easily connect sensors such as the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, soil moisture sensor and even a NEO-M9N GPS breakout. What is Seeed Studio\u2019s Grove Connector? Seeed Studio\u2019s Grove connector is a proprietary connector for its range of boards and boards made in partnership with Arduino. The Grove connector is a 4-pin cable which can be used with analog, PWM, digital IO and I2C. Grove is compatible with STEMMA components, but only for I2C devices as analog, PWM and digital IO are not compatible. If you are unsure, just take a look at the component. If it has SDA / SCL pins, then it is an I2C device. If you have never used Grove connections before, then the Grove Beginner Kit is worth your investment. In the kit we get an OLED screen, DHT11 temperature sensor, microphone, light sensor and a bonus Arduino compatible board.","title":"What is the difference between STEMMA and STEMMA QT"},{"location":"glossary/connectors/#connector-comparison","text":"Device Manufacturer Connector Voltage / Logic Protocols Year Introduced Compatible Grove Seeed Studio Proprietary 4 pin 2.0mm pin pitch, Compatible with STEMMA I2C only 3-5V DC 4 Pin I2C / Analog / Digital / PWM 2010 N/A QWIIC Sparkfun JST SH 4 pin 1.0mm pin pitch 3V DC I2C 2017 N/A STEMMA Adafruit JST PH 3 / 4 Pin 2.0mm pin pitch 3-5V DC 4 Pin I2C or 3 Pin Analog / Digital / PWM 2014 intended to be compatible with Grove STEMMA QT Adafruit JST SH 4 pin 1.0mm pin pitch 3-5V DC I2C 2018 intended to be compatible with QWIIC Which Connector is Right For You? The answer is based on what boards you already have and what you want to achieve. If you have Adafruit\u2019s boards, then you will most likely have some form of STEMMA / STEMMA QT connector and so the entire range of add-ons is available to you. You will also have access to SparkFun\u2019s QWIIC range of add ons which opens up a plethora of options for your projects. This is also true if you have any of SparkFun\u2019s boards with QWIIC connectors. Seeed\u2019s Grove connectors work with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and now the Raspberry Pi Pico. So buying one set of Grove components is good value for those that wish to use them across multiple platforms. Ultimately the choice is yours. What projects you wish to build will dictate the choices that you make. But no matter what choice you make, all of these connectors make electronics a breeze and give you the confidence to learn new skills without worrying about your wiring.","title":"Connector Comparison"},{"location":"glossary/crickit/","text":"Crickit Back to Index Related Itsy Bitsy , QT Py Crickit Adafruit CRICKIT for Circuit Playground Express https://www.adafruit.com/product/3093 Adafruit CRICKIT FeatherWing for any Feather https://www.adafruit.com/product/3343 Adafruit CRICKIT HAT for Raspberry Pi https://www.adafruit.com/product/3957 Adafruit CRICKIT for micro:bit https://www.adafruit.com/product/3928 Adabox 008 https://www.adafruit.com/product/3906","title":"Crickit"},{"location":"glossary/crickit/#crickit","text":"","title":"Crickit"},{"location":"glossary/crickit/#back-to-index","text":"Related Itsy Bitsy , QT Py Crickit Adafruit CRICKIT for Circuit Playground Express https://www.adafruit.com/product/3093 Adafruit CRICKIT FeatherWing for any Feather https://www.adafruit.com/product/3343 Adafruit CRICKIT HAT for Raspberry Pi https://www.adafruit.com/product/3957 Adafruit CRICKIT for micro:bit https://www.adafruit.com/product/3928 Adabox 008 https://www.adafruit.com/product/3906","title":"Back to Index"},{"location":"glossary/feather/","text":"Feather Back to Index Related Itsy Bitsy , QT Py Feather Format is an Adafruit standard format for microcontrollers (Large, comparatively for microcontrollers.

We\u2019ve been using the Nordict nRF series for a loooooong time (anyone else remember the nRF8001? it was like the AT90S2313 of bluetooth le for us). nRF52840 is the first one with native USB \u2013 and its plenty fast as a Cortex M4 at 64MHz and 256K of RAM. we already did a module-less route of this chip on the Circuit Playground Bluefruit so we know the schem capture is right. QT Py ESP32-S3 is also next https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/07/qt-py-with-esp32-s3/ this is a swap-out of the ESP32-S2 QT Py for the new ESP32-S3 chip. The S3 is really a nice piece of kit \u2013 dual core is back and it also re-adds BLE. It\u2019s basically an ESP32 with native USB, we\u2019re looking forward to it! note that the S3 chip looks a lot like the S2 but the chip pinout is NOT the same, the reset, and some power pins have moved. and some gpio shifted down one. also, looks like the dual DAC was removed. anyways, just watch out don\u2019t think you can use the exact same layout. we had to shift a few parts but it all still looks like it fits! top part is identical to the S2 QT Py, and the bottom only shifted a few passives around. we\u2019ll get some 4 layer prototypes on order. Desk of Lady Ada https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC7oodxTWgE 1/9/2022 This weekend we cranked through 3.5 QT Py designs (we didnt finish routing one, its a toughie!) - we already make SAMD21, RP2040 and ESP32-S2 and we wanted to add some more chips to the mix: ESP32-S3 (dual core version of the S2), ESP32 Pico (OG ESP with built in flash/psram), ESP32-C3 (Risc-V wifi!) and nRF52840 (BLE wonder-chip from Nordic). the last one is what we didn't get to finish routing because its a particularly tough one. The other 3 worked out fine with a 4 layer PCB. We also designed a few 'BFF' boards - that fit onto a QT Py like a shield. https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/01/15/feather-huzzah-esp32-v2/ The Feather ESP32 is a classic Adafruit board, used in thousands and thousands of projects. And we love it so\u2026but with the CP2104 going EOL and requiring us to do a light re-spin for the CP2102N revision, we thought maybe we\u2019d do a gut renovation. With the new ESP32 PICO module, we save a ton of space AND have 8 MB Flash / 2MB PSRAM instead of the WROOM\u2019s 4 MB Flash & no PSRAM. the PICO is also much smaller, so we have room to upgrade the USB micro B to Type C, add a NeoPixel, STEMMA QT with separate LDO, and even a user button on the very last unused input pin. However, we did have to shuffle a few pins around. the named pins got some changes, so for example, RX and TX used to be 16 and 17 respectively \u2013 but those pins are used internally on the PICO module so they\u2019re no longer available. on the V2 feather they\u2019re now 8 and 9. all of the analog pins and the numbered pins are the same, just SPI/I2C/UART named pins are different. that should make code be \u2018drop in replacement\u2019 as long as the named pins/ports are used instead of the underlying io pad names. since code needs to be recompiled for the variant, this would be a fully new product ID. however, i think for the bump in capabilities and capacity it is worth an upgrade!

In addition - on the comparison page it states that Grove is a proprietary 4 pin 2.0mm pitch connector. STEMMA attempts to be as cross-compatible as possible with both Grove and Gravity (compatible connectors & 3-5V power/logic). STEMMA QT is cross-compatible with Qwiic - STEMMA QT connector/cable is same as Qwiic. You can use STEMMA QT devices with Qwiic devices/controllers.

In addition - on the comparison page it states that Grove is a proprietary 4 pin 2.0mm pitch connector.
