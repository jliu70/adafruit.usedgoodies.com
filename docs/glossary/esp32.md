[ESP32 Family Feature Grid](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/chip-series-comparison.html)
    As mentioned from: [Adafruit Blog: ESP32 Family Feature Grid](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/08/16/esp32uesday-esp32-family-feature-grid/)
    I struggle to remember the differences among the original ESP32 and the subsequent S2, S3 and C3 Series microcontrollers. Was going to carefully assemble a feature grid to organize this, and share it here on the blog…but as it turns out Espressif already has a fantastic one, I just didn’t think to look here. It’s perfection! And long!
