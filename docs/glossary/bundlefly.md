### [Back to Index](index.md)



All CircuitPython guides on the [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com) have a feature called **[Bundlefly](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/04/14/adafruitlearningsystem-weekly-update-project-bundle/
)** which allow users to download one zip file which includes the code, all required libraries, and if needed, asset files. 

You should find the download link called `Download Project Bundle` located at the beginning of any CircuitPython code section.

Once you have extracted all the files from the downloaded zip file, you just drag-and-drop them onto your microntroller CIRCUITPY drive.

Adafruit Bundlefly is the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether youâ€™re a beginner or an expert.


Adafruit automatically checks which libraries and assets are required for the project and bundle them up for you. 

- No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need
- No more looking for other files or dependencies. 
- Simple one-click download via `Download Project Bundle` link
- Extract the files and copy to your CIRCUITPY drive
