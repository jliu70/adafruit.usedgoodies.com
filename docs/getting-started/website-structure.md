# How this website is organized

This website has three main sections, **Hardware**, **CircuitPython**, and **Glossary**

For beginners, the Hardware and CircuitPython sections offer an opinionated roadmap/walkthrough of the Adafruit ecosystem.

For more experienced people or to quickly look up the definition of a specific term, feel free to jump to the Glossary.
