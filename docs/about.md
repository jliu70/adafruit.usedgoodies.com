# About


This guide is for people new to Adafruit and to electronics.  The focus is on the Adafruit ecosystem -- to provide a roadmap for people new to the Adafruit ecosystem.  We will review Adafruit lingo and branding.  This website does not cover electronics in general --  Along the way some electronics will be discussed, but this website will not cover topics in depth.  As much as possible, links to additional resources or references will be provided.

!!! note
    I am not affiliated with Adafruit in any way, and I am not being paid by Adafruit.  I'm just a huge fan of Adafruit.  I wrote this guide because I haven't seen anything on Adafruit similar to this.
