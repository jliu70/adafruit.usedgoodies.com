# CircuitPython

The majority of [Adafruit hardware](../hardware/index.md) can run either

- [Arduino](https://arduino.cc) 

    or 

- [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org)  

Some [Adafruit hardware](../hardware/index.md) is also compatible with [MakeCode](https://makecode.org).


This website will focus on CircuitPython which is a version of python for microcontrollers recommended for beginners who are just getting started.  [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com) is the principle backer for [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org).  

!!! note
    *A Beginner's Recommendation*.

    **CircuitPython**


I recommend [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org) over Arduino for beginners because `python` is a more accesible programming language than `C++` (which is what Arduino uses).  Python syntax is more similar to plain language, and Python gives beginners an easier feedback loop as Python does not need to be compiled in the way that C++ (Arduino) code requires.
