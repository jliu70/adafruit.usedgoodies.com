# Hardware

The Adafruit lingo for their hardware is quite extensive and can be confusing to someone new to the Adafruit ecosystem.  One of the primary goals of this website is to help newcomers sort through this cornicopia of terminology.


## Microcontrollers

Adafruit manufactures and sells their own microcontrollers 

- Microcontrollers are single purpose computers 
    - limited storage and memory
    - limited processing power


Microcontrollers vs General Purpose Computer

- Use of Microcontrollers is fine for most cases
- When you need more computational power, you may want to use a Raspberry Pi
    - For example, if you wish to have a web dashboard to interface with, then you will need to use a Raspberry Pi

## Recommended: First Adafruit Hardware for Beginners

!!! note
    *A Beginner's Recommendation*.

    **[Circuit Playground Bluefruit](../glossary/circuit_playground#circuit-playground-bluefruit)**

Among the many Adafruit devices, the [Circuit Playground Bluefruit](../glossary/circuit_playground#circuit-playground-bluefruit) is more accesible to beginners.  It is a great piece of hardware to start with.

## Comprehensive list of hardware supported by CircuitPython
List of all the hardware currently supported by CircuitPython (Adafruit and other vendors) is available at the [CircuitPython Downloads Page](https://circuitpython.org/downloads).

As of Feb 2022 

- There are over 270 boards supported by CircuitPython and that list grows everyday.
    - The list is sorted by number of downloads.  
        - The most popular board -- the Raspberry Pi Pico -- is not manufactured by Adafruit.
