WIP

Adafruit is working on new add-on boards for the Raspberry Pi Pico form factor.

With a wide variety of names for add-on boards: [shields](shield.md), [capes](cape.md), [FeatherWings](feather.md#featherwing), [HATs](hat.md), gizmos, etc., Adafruit wanted a name for their line of boards.

As the new Pico W is being dubbed the “Picow” by the community, cow-themed ideas are being used. Adafruit, after consideration, announced on their Ask an Engineer show, Top Secret segment, their add-on boards will be called “bells” (like cowbell) – [Adafruit Top Secret](https://youtu.be/UAl3oqVa9eY).
