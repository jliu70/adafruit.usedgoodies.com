## Questions, comments, suggestions or error corrections

I hope you found this website to be helpful.  

If you have additional questions, comments, suggests or error corrections, please feel free to send feedback.



### Option 1: Adafruit Forums 

The easiest way to send feedback is via the Adafruit Forums:

- [Adafruit Forum Post: Adafruit for Newbies - Reference website to help newcomers](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=188399)

You will need to create a free Adafruit forum account in order to post.

For newbies, the benefits are: 

- Straight forward and simple to post to the forum.
- If there is a question where I do not know the answer, Adafruit support or other community members may also be able to help



### Option 2: Github Issue 

For more experienced people, if you have a Github account, you may also choose to open an issue on the repo for the site itself:

- [Github adafruit.usedgoodies.com repo - Issues](https://github.com/jliu70/adafruit.usedgoodies.com/issues)

Please note that while I will see submissions here, that it's not as visible to the rest of the community.
